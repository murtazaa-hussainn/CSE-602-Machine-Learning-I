## Description:
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning pipeline for the execution of K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classifier. The pipeline is implemented as part of Assignment for the course CSE 602 - Machine Learning-I.

## Implemented ML Pipeline:
The implemented machine learning pipeline involves the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation

## Datasets Used:
The pipeline is executed on the following datasets:
1. [Dry Bean Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset)
2. [Mushroom Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom)
3. [Estimation of Obesity Levels Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition)
4. [Website Phishing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/379/website+phishing)
5. [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)

## Execution:
To execute the machine learning pipeline on any of the datasets mentioned above, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the code.
3. Run the main script for the desired dataset.

## Additional Notes:
- Each dataset directory contains its respective scripts and data files for execution.
- Detailed documentation for the code and implementation can be found within the respective directories.
