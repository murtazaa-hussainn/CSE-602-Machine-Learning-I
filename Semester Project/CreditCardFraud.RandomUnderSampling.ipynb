For Logistic Regression, the accuracy was better without CV, however, the accuracy decreased but then improved as the number of folds increased. One possible explanation for this can be that the data has 7 target classes and approximately 500 rows after data cleaning is performed. Hence when CV is used, there is a small chunk of data available to train the model from, hence the reduced accuracy. However, as the number of folds increase, the data available for training increases and hence accuracy increases as well as there is more data to train the model on. For Random Forest, without using CV, the model was overfitting on Training data hence the reduced accuracy, however, as CV helps models avoid overfitting, the test accuracy started increasing as the number of folds increased."

    "### Summary:\n",
    "To Summarize the above results, the following things about CV can be concluded:\n",
    "1. CV has its many benefits of use, such as avoiding overfitting, improving model fit.\n",
    "2. In the above interpretations, CV mostly attributed to increase model fitting and sometimes even higher accuracies of model.\n",
    "3. A case where CV did perform poorly was where the size of dataset was small.\n",
    "4. Some general observations regarding performance are that the values of folds should not be too high for CV as it is time and compute intensive. Also increasing the folds not always helps the model fit better."
